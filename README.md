# Machine Learning with Python

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository!

In the summer of 2024, I enrolled in the German Udemy course by Jannis Seemann titled [Machine Learning from A-Z: Learn Python & R for Data Science!](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-komplett/) which I completed on July 14, 2024.

My goal was to become more familiar with Machine Learning in general, understand the theory behind various models, learn specific techniques utilized in Machine Learning and build robust ML models using Python. This repository is a result of my journey through that course and showcases the machine learning skills I acquired by completing the course.

## About this Repository

In this repository, you will find a comprehensive collection of projects which cover a broad scope of the Machine Learning landscape. 

These projects include:

### Regression Models
- **Simple Linear Regression**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**

### Classification Models
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forests**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

### Clustering Models
- **K-Means Clustering**

### Machine Learning Techniques

- **Train/Test Split**
- **K-Fold Cross Validation**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **One-Hot Encoding**
- **Label Encoding**
- **Feature Scaling**
- **Model Evaluation**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Principal Component Analysis**

## Structure of this Repository

I created a folder for each section of the course. In each folder, you will find a Jupyter Notebook which revolves around a certain topic (e.g. Simple Linear Regression). 

Each Jupyter Notebook contains:

- **Theoretical Overviews**: Understanding the concepts behind a model or ML concept
- **Practical Implementations**: Hands-on coding examples and applications
- **In-Depth Explanations**: Detailed discussions of the algorithms and ML techniques
- **Visualizations**: Graphs and plots to illustrate key points
- **Best Practices**: Tips and techniques for effective machine learning
- **Conclusions**: Summaries for each section

Note: I led the development and implementation of all the code showcased in the repository and also utilized ChatGPT to refine both the code and theoretical explanations, thereby enhancing the overall quality. The course focuses on both Python and R but I mainly focused on the implementation of Python code.
