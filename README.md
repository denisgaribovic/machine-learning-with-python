# Machine Learning with Python

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository!

In the summer of 2024, I enrolled in the German Udemy course by Jannis Seemann titled [Machine Learning from A-Z: Learn Python & R for Data Science!](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-komplett/). This repository is a result of my journey through that course and beyond.

## About This Repository

My goal was to become more familiar with Machine Learning in general, understand the theory behind various models, learn specific techniques utilized in Machine Learning and implement ML models using Python. This repository aims to demonstrate the results and showcases the machine learning skills I acquired by completing the course. It also serves as a centralized place where I maintain a collection of frequently used code snippets and methodologies for future reference.

## Projects

Here, you will find a comprehensive collection of projects, including:

### Regression Models
- **Simple Linear Regression**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**

### Classification Models
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forests**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

### Clustering Models
- **K-Means Clustering**

### Machine Learning Techniques

- **Train/Test Split**
- **Model Evaluation**
- **K-Fold Cross Validation**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **One-Hot Encoding**
- **Label Encoding**
- **Feature Scaling**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Principal Component Analysis**

### Bonus
- **Natural Language Processing**
- **Neural Networks**

## How are the projects structured?

The projects are sorted in chronological order. Each section of the course is represented by a folder. In each folder, you will find a Jupyter Notebook. These Notebooks contain:

- **Theoretical Overviews**: Understanding the concepts behind a model or ML concept
- **Practical Implementations**: Hands-on coding examples and applications
- **In-Depth Explanations**: Detailed discussions of the algorithms and ML techniques
- **Visualizations**: Graphs and plots to illustrate key points
- **Best Practices**: Tips and techniques for effective machine learning
- **Conclusions**: Summaries for each section

## Dependencies

- Python 3.5+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
